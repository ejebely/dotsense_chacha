.sense for the HTC ChaCha
This is the progress of the Sense 3.5 for the HTC ChaCha.

+Data
+GPS
+GPU

-WiFi
-Bluetooth
-Backlight Keyboard

Have a look and see what you can add please.

-NOTE- This is not the full source just the folder which is required for flashing. New HTC ChaCha kernel will be on my git at a later time.

-ANOTHER GREAT NOTE-
If you download beware that the current work may not be safe and any ChaCha bricks is your fault.


Thanks Luke Arran
